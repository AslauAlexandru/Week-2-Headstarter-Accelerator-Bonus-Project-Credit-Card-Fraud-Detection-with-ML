Week 2 Headstarter Accelerator Bonus Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection with ML
In this project, your task is to build an ML model to determine whether or not a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not.
[Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection/data) from Kaggle. Simulated Credit Card Transactions generated using Sparkov.

## About Dataset

This is a simulated credit card transaction dataset containing legitimate and fraud transactions from the duration 1st Jan 2019 - 31st Dec 2020. It covers credit cards of 1000 customers doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants.

## Steps for run
[Credit Card Fraud Detection with ML]() (google colab) and [web app](https://github.com/AslauAlexandru/Week-2-Headstarter-Accelerator-Bonus-Project-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-with-ML/blob/main/main.py).
First I run in the google colab (or in jupyter notebook local), after that download the machine learning models as ```.pkl``` pickle. Second I upload the machine learning models as ```.pkl``` pickle to Replit (or in other evironment). In my case I use these steps.
